"""
Multi-clustering comparison and RF-driven feature selection for clustering.

Two responsibilities:
  1. compare_all_methods()         — score and rank all clustering methods side-by-side
  2. extract_rf_feature_importances() — read the step-5 RF model and rank features
  3. recommend_clustering_features()  — suggest a leaner feature set for re-clustering

Comparison metrics used
------------------------
- Silhouette score    — higher is better; [-1, 1]
- Davies-Bouldin      — lower is better; [0, ∞)
- Calinski-Harabasz  — higher is better; [0, ∞)
- Adjusted Rand Index — pairwise label agreement; [-0.5, 1]

CLI workflow after finding best clustering
-------------------------------------------
Once you identify the best method in the notebook:

  1. Save its labels as a named checkpoint:
         python run_pipeline.py --steps 3 --save-market-code
     (saves balanced_cluster as market_code_clustered)

  2. Propagate through downstream steps:
         python run_pipeline.py --steps 4,5,6,7 --market-code clustered --plots

  3. Update config/regime_labels.yaml with new regime names.
